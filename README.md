## How To Use

Example docker-compose.yml for mysql:

```yaml
---
version: '3.9'
services:
   # Integration Testing - Tests that run in phpunit with WordPress + MySQL
  ## Runner for phpunit
  phpunit:
    image: josh412/wp-phpunit
    command:
      - bash
    ## Wait to start until the database server for testing is ready.
    depends_on:
      - testwpdb
    environment:
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: examplepass
      DATABASE_HOST: testwpdb
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    volumes:
      ## Map this directory into the test plugin directory
      - ./:/plugin

  #Database for tests
  testwpdb:
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: examplepass
    image: mariadb:10.5.8
    healthcheck:
      test: "/usr/bin/mysql --user=wordpress --password=wordpress --execute \"SHOW DATABASES;\""
      interval: 3s
      timeout: 1s
      retries: 5
```

Run ```docker-compose run phpunit```, wait for it to initialize completely, when prompt is displayed, run ```phpunit``` or ```phpcs``` (as appropriate).

## WordPress and PHP Version

You can set WordPress and PHP versions in two ways:

1. Set `WORDPRESS_VERSION` and/ or `PHP_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables.
2. Use a provided tag

You can see the full list of tags [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/josh412/wp-phpunit/tags). This is an example of using PHP 8.1 and WordPress 5.7:

```yaml
---
version: '3.9'
services:
   # Integration Testing - Tests that run in phpunit with WordPress + MySQL
  ## Runner for phpunit
  phpunit:
    image: josh412/wp-phpunit:php-8.1-wp-5.7
    command:
      - bash
    ## Wait to start until the database server for testing is ready.
    depends_on:
      - testwpdb
    environment:
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: examplepass
      DATABASE_HOST: testwpdb
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    volumes:
      ## Map this directory into the test plugin directory
      - ./:/plugin

  #Database for tests
  testwpdb:
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: examplepass
    image: mariadb:10.5.8
    healthcheck:
      test: "/usr/bin/mysql --user=wordpress --password=wordpress --execute \"SHOW DATABASES;\""
      interval: 3s
      timeout: 1s
      retries: 5
```
